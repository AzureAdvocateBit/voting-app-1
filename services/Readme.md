# REST API

This is a serverless API with two endpoints:

1. Endpoint that lists teams available: [https://graphqlvoting.azurewebsites.net/api/score](https://graphqlvoting.azurewebsites.net/api/score)

1. Endoint that allows increasing points:[https://graphqlvoting.azurewebsites.net/api/score/{id}](https://graphqlvoting.azurewebsites.net/api/score/2)

## Run locally

1. Fork and clone the repository in your local

1. ⚠️ Open the *services* folder in VS Code

1. In VS Code, go to the Azure icon on the left hand side panel and in the Functions extension click on *Create new project* icon to initialize a new function app. *Overwrite all existing settings*

1. Create a new [Azure Cosmos DB](https://aka.ms/portal-nceu18) account using MongoDB API model. Create a database called *admin* and a collection called *Team*

1. Populate your collection with a couple of items. In *Data Explorer* -> *admin* -> *Team* -> *Documents* add new entries to retrieve later:

```
{
  "id" : "1",
  "name" : "red",
  "points" : 0
}

{
  "id" : "2",
  "name" : "blue",
  "points" : 11912
}

```

1. Replace the contents of your local.settings.json with the configs in local.settings.example.json. Next, add your CosmosDB settings. You can get the connection settings from the Azure portal - Settings -> Connection String

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
    "CosmosDBURL":
      "mongodb://<your-HOST-goes-here>:<your-PORT-goes-here>/?ssl=true",
    "CosmosDBUser": "<your-USERNAME-goes-here>",
    "CosmosDBPass": "<your-PASSWORD-goes-here>"
  }
}
```

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

1. In VS Code go to the *Debugging* panel and click debug

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:7071/api/score](http://localhost:7071/api/score) and you should see a json similar to:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "red",
    "points": 0
  },
  {
    "id": "2",
    "name": "blue",
    "points": 19113
  }
]
```

1. Deploy your API to the clouds ☁️☁️! Using VS Code, click on the Azure icon on the left menu and in the Functions extension click the blue arrow button to deploy your function to the cloud. Follow steps displayed in the prompt to eitehr create a new function or deploy to an existing one.

1. Upload local settings to the cloud using the Functions extension. Navigate to the function you just created, click to expand, right click on *Application Settings* -> *Download Remote Settings* -> *Upload Local Settings* - replace all

1. Copy the url listed in the logs and open it in the browser to call your newly created function. i.e [https://<your_function_name>.azurewebsites.net/api/score](https://<your_function_name>.azurewebsites.net/api/score)

*NOTE*: the link in the logs will give you a url that contains the Function name (i.e. GetScore); we configured our routes to custom ones in function.json (score & score/id)
